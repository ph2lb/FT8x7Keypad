# FT8x7Keypad
A Arduino based keypad for the Yaesu FT8x7 series.

This is just the prove of concept and there is still a lot of things to do.
Tested it on my Yaesu FT897D with a Arduino R3 Uno and 4x4 keypad.

FT857D.cpp and FT857D.h are taken from the : 

Arduino library for controlling a Yaesu FT857D radio via CAT commands.
